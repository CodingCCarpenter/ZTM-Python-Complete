# OOP

# This is the class, which is like the blueprints for making objects.
class BigObject: 
    pass

# Each time we instanciate our class, (call and store it), we create an object

# 1st instance/object
obj1 = BigObject()

# 2nd instance/object
obj2 = BigObject()

#3rd instance/object
obj3 = BigObject()
